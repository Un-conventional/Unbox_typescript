<!-- description of unbox here? -->

<details>
<summary><font color="#FFD700">Unbox</font>?</summary>
This is <font color="#9c64f7">UltraBox</font> but with my ideas added on. This also is sort of a testing ground for me to learn code.<br>
Some ideas come from how sound chips work and that and many ideas may seem excessive but pushing limits is fun.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is this mod for?</summary>
This mod is for anyone regardless of skill level, I strongly suggest checking out <a href=https://ultraabox.github.io>UltraBox</a> first though.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why does <font color="#FFD700">Unbox</font> exist?</summary>
It exists because I wanted it to exist. I got tired of asking "what if X existed" or "why can't W, X, Y apply to Z as well".
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is the b in <font color="#FFD700">Unbox</font> not a capitalized B? Why is it not called <font color="#a1afb0">UnBox</font> or <font color="#a1afb0">UNBox</font>?</summary>
Because I said so and I found it weird having it spelled that way.
</details>


<details>
<summary>How does Unbox differ from UltraBox?</summary>
Unbox aims to add features Unconventional wants to add. The current features include:
        <details>
        <summary>+- 24 Pitch Shift Range</summary>
            I felt the range was too small so I increased it. It still works the same as normal Pitch Shift but with more range.
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary>0%-100% Pulse Width Range</summary>
        The fact that 1%-50% just felt limiting. With what I added, 0-100% is possible if you include the decimal offset. There is just so much that is possible with that range increase
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary>Several new chip waves and presets</summary>
        <li>The new "chip" chipwaves/presets mimic what exists on chips - These are a work in progress! Feedback is requested to make these better.</li>
        <li>The new Presets that arent chip mostly consist of instruments I like and a few have sentimental value. These are also work in progress!</li>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary>Increased max tempo to 1000</summary>
        <li>Ever wanted to make songs that are faster than 500 "tempo"? For "Pseudo Overclock" that would limit you to about 200Hz. I increased it to 1000 so 400Hz "Pseudo Overclock" should be available. I would like to increase it to 10k at one point for 1kHz.</li>
        <li>I also added new rhythms that should help out if you increase the beats per bar in tandem with higher tempo. You still can edit the tempo via the text box regardless. </li>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary>Set playerhead to start of loop</summary>
        How many times did you want to jump to the start of the loop? All the time? Yeah, that is why I made this shortcut. It even was put in <font color="#9c64f7">UltraBox</font>!
        </details>
    
        <details>
        <summary>Two new themes, Classic and Legacy.</summary>
        <li>Classic is the default theme, I think its nice.</li>
        <li>Legacy is the original theme but it has issues but I still like it.</li>
        </details>    

        <details>
        <summary>Duty Cycle?</summary>
        This will be replaced with a Sequence/Macro system. I wanted to revive a function from an old mod called <font color="#FFCA00">SandBox</font> and that mod had Duty Cycle but it was limited to a few pulse widths and only 2 cycle types.
        <li>This new system won't be limited to just Duty Cycle</li>
        </details>

<details>
<summary>How do I add custom samples?</summary>
Since Unbox doesn't have a web server of its own, you'll have to first upload your sample to a CORS-friendly website.
<ul><li>The easiest to use are <a href="https://filegarden.com/">File Garden</a> or <a href="https://catbox.moe/">Catbox</a>.</li></ul>

Next, you have to copy the URL of the sound itself. The URL should end with the filetype, such as <code>.wav</code> or <code>.mp3</code>.
<br><br>

To import it into Unbox, open the Edit tab, scroll to the bottom, and click on "Add Custom Samples..."
<br><br>

Paste your url and press "Okay." If everything goes smoothly, Unbox will reload and your sample will be available in the preset list.
"TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource." is not a bug on our end. That is probably you ISP blocking it.

<summary>How do I add samples to UB Offline?</summary>

<!-- <details> -->
<!-- <summary>What are the original sources of the built-in samples? Can I use them without legal repercussions?</summary> -->
<!-- stuff -->
<!-- huge list of all the legacysample origins here -->

<details>
<summary>Does Unbox have an offline version?</summary>
NO!, Not yet but you can access UltraBox's <a href="https://github.com/ultraabox/ultrabox_typescript/releases">here</a>.<br>
You can either download an OS-specific version that has custom sampling support, or the generic HTML version that lacks custom sampling support. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Unbox claim ownership over songs created with it?</summary>
Unbox does not claim ownership over songs created with it, so original songs belong to their authors.<br><br>
Neither Unbox nor its creator assume responsibility for any copyrighted material played on Unbox. No songs are ever received, recorded, or distributed by Unbox's servers. All song data is contained in the URL after the hash (#) mark, and Unbox running inside your browser converts that data into sound waves.

Yes! You can download and use <a href="https://github.com/ultraabox/ultrabox_typescript" target="_blank">the source code</a> under the MIT license.<br>

<summary>When will <code>x</code> feature be added?</summary>
You can track the progress of new features on the <a href="https://github.com/Un-conventional/Unbox_typescript/issues">issues page</a>.<br>
Please be patient; I work on Unbox in with my free time. I can't guarantee that anything will be out in a timely manner. (I may delay it out of spite if you push >:} )
